<h3>Here we are using an interactive explanatory data visualization to better analyze
COVID 19 dataset. We are using the D3.js JavaScript library for implementing an
interactive and dynamic web visualization.</h3>

<h3>Hypotheses: According to the Virology experts, [1] the COVID 19 pandemic will also
follow an epidemiological model, which follows a normal distribution (bell curve). So
when we perform our visualization over a period of time either for infected cases or
death, it should follow a bell curve. Also, [2] it's proposed by the experts that COVID
19 also has a fatality rate of 3.4% which we will visualize. Also, we will be
visualizing the COVID situation of some of the countries on a map.</h3>
